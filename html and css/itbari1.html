 	1. Take a study break every 40 to 50 minutes
Research shows that working in blocks of 40 to 50 minutes is optimal for productivity.

If you feel as if you can’t focus for that long, try out the Pomodoro Technique for a start.

2. If you’re feeling unmotivated, set a timer for two minutes
If you don’t feel like doing work, set a timer for two minutes. Then tell yourself that you just need to focus for that amount of time.

Chances are that once you’ve started work, you’ll continue even after the two minutes are up.

3. Make good use of your travel time
It’s tempting to use your commute time to surf the Internet or go through your social media feeds.

But you can use the time to think about a concept you haven’t grasped, write in your gratitude journal, or listen to an audiobook.

This is a simple time management tip that goes a long way in helping you become a successful student!

4. Keep a time log for a few days
Do you feel as if you’ve been unproductive, but you’re not sure where all your time has been going?

If so, I recommend that you keep a time log for three to four days.

Keep track of everything you do during those few days. You’ll then have a much better idea as to how you can manage your time more effectively.

5. If you don’t understand a new concept, speak to your teacher right away
If you do this, you’ll save a lot of time in the long run, because you’ll be clarifying your doubts as they arise.

6. Keep an ongoing list of every single thing you have to do
ChecklistSave

Don’t rely on your brain as a storage device.

Instead, write down every single thing you need to do: assignments, projects, errands, etc.

Review the list daily to ensure that you’re working on the most important task at any given time.

7. Unfollow everyone on social media, except the people you really care about
I did this a year ago, and it’s saved me hundreds of hours!

Not only that, I realise that I don’t even miss not getting updates from most of those people I’d been following.

8. Turn off notifications on your tablet and phone
Do this and say goodbye to all the interruptions you’ve been getting when you were supposed to be focusing on your schoolwork.

This tip alone will make you a much more productive student.

9. Unsubscribe from all YouTube channels
This tip is similar to Tip #7. If you unsubscribe from all YouTube channels, you’ll discover that there are only a few channels whose videos you really enjoy.

These are the channels that you’ll intentionally visit so you can watch the latest videos they’ve posted.

Which means you don’t actually need to subscribe to these channels!

10. Mute your group chats on your phone
In most group chats, there’s a lot of “noise” – messages that are neither urgent nor important.

Mute your group chats, and look through them once a day to ensure that you haven’t missed out anything important.

11. Use a very long password for your tablet and phone
Set a password that’s 15 to 20 characters long.

By doing this, you’ll become more conscious about when and how you use your tablet and phone.

You won’t use these devices mindlessly, which means that you’ll become a more focused and effective student.

12. Delete all social media apps on your tablet and phone
Once again, this tip will empower you to use your tablet and phone more intentionally.

If you want to check your social media feeds, you can still do so through the Internet browser.

But you’re less likely to do so as often because of the slight inconvenience, as compared to opening the social media app directly.

13. Before you start a study session, put your tablet and phone in another room
This is a simple way to ensure that these electronic devices don’t distract you.

By maximising the effectiveness of each study session, you’ll manage your time better.

14. At the beginning of each study session, write down the task you’re going to work on
PlanningSave

It’s easy to get sidetracked during a study session, which is where this tip comes in handy.

On a rough sheet of paper, write down the specific task you’re going to work on (e.g. Science assignment, Question #1 to 5) and put it on your study table.

This will remind you to stay focused on that task as you’re working on it.

15. Create a rough schedule for each day of the week
Every successful person I know follows a daily routine. So do these famous people.

To be a master of time management, create a schedule for each day of the week, e.g. when you’ll exercise, relax, study, spend time with family.

It’s impossible to follow the schedule to the minute. But you’ll be far more productive if you use the schedule as a rough framework, rather than not using a schedule at all.

16. Be realistic about what you can accomplish each day
Many students overestimate what they can accomplish each day. When they don’t manage to complete everything they intended to, they get discouraged and lose motivation.

So be realistic when you plan your day, and assume that there will be a few unforeseen interruptions.

 	It’s that time of year again and we can hear the school bells ringing! It can be hard to adjust from the dog days of summer to the busy and fast pace of the school year. Here are eight tips to get back into the school mode and start this year off right!

Tip #1: Have the Proper School Supplies that you need for your classes! 
I highly suggest getting folders and binder with patterns and designs to make note taking more fun. During the first day of class most teachers will tell you everything they require for their courses. Make sure that you get the specified supplies so that you are able to keep up with the class work and stay organized.

Tip #2: Get an Agenda!
During the school year is such a busy time! Between taking test, doing home work, attending activities, and school events it can be really hard to keep track of everything. By keeping an updated agenda you can better manage your time and know what you have to accomplish. Having a agenda will definitely help you with time management. Time management is key to being successful and staying on top of everything you need to do!

Tip #3: Know your Course Syllabus
Knowing your class schedule is so important for being successful in the course your taking. Teachers will typical hand out your syllabus in class or post it online. I highly suggest keeping it in a safe and convenient place so you can frequently view. Knowing when you have papers and projects due is so important for passing the course and keeping up your grades. Having the syllabus will allow you to plan ahead and give yourself proper time to complete every assignment and get great grades!

Tip #4: Do Not Procrastinate
This is something that we have all been guilty of in the past and have learned the stressful repercussions. A habit is created in three weeks so if you study for every course your taking daily in 21 days that will be a new habit for you. Dedicating a little bit of time everyday to the courses you are taking is definitely going to positively impact your grades and make you a better student!

Tip #5: Know What is Expected of You 
rIt is very important to know what your teachers are expecting from you. Pay attention to what the teacher is saying about the workload of the class and what they are hoping for you to get out of it. Teacher are supposed to want you to succeed so most likely they will provide you with what you need to do to thrive. Knowing their expectations and achieving them will help your year start smoothly. Always remember that communicating with your teachers is key for understanding their expectations.

Tip #6: Get Involved
Getting involved with your school community is great because you can pursue your interest and meet peers who have the same and similar interest as you. Many studies have shown that students who are involved in sports and school activities are able to achieve higher GPA’s. If you enjoy playing sports try out for the school team. If you are a musician or actor then join your school band or theatre company and share your talent with your fellow peers. Join clubs that you are interested in and attend all the meetings. If your school doesn’t have the sports you play, a club you want to join, or a musical or theatre program then talk to your school administrators and see if you are able to start your own! It is amazing to have something that you are passionate about and enjoy doing so never be afraid to pursue your interests.

Tip #7: Learn What Type of Learner You Are 
Everyone is individual and so is the way you learn ! There are three main types of learning styles which are auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. Knowing what type of learner you are is going to help you be a better student and have better studying habits.When you are able to determine the type of learning style that is best for you, you will find better results when you are studying and it will result in higher test scores! I highly encourage you to do some research and determine the type of learner you are so you can personalize your studying.

Tip #8: List of academic goals
Write out a list of goals that you want to achieve for the upcoming school year! Do you want to make the lead role in the play, get that varsity spot on the basket ball team, improve your grades, You can reach all the goals you set for this year! When you write down every goal you are able to plan and realize what you need to do to prepare for them. Having that list can be a driving and motivating force to help you work to achieve those goals.
